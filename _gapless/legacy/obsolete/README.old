Gapless: Bayesian inference of splice isoform structure for paired-end mRNA-Seq

Website: http://rulai.cshl.edu/gapless

Authors
Chaolin Zhang <czhang@rockefeller.edu>


Usage
basis.pl [options] <read1.bed> <read2.bed>
 -isoform [file]: file name of splice isoform database
 -E        [int]: big exon size (default=400)
 -big           : read number is big (i.e. over ~6M reads)
 -o        [dir]: output dir (default=./gapless_out)
 -v             : verbose


Additional notes:

1. Make sure you put the .pm files in a directory perl can find
2. The isoform database includes exons, exon pairs and exon trios in the BED format 
   (available at the website for hg18 and mm9).
3. read1.bed and read2.bed are reads that can be uniquely aligned to the genome or 
   exon junctions in the BED format. They can be generated by any existing programs
   like Eland, bowtie, SOAP, etc.
4. The exon junction database for hg18 and mm9 is available at the website.
